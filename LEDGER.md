# Ledger

Every mistake the agent made, in order, with how it was caught and what it cost. Discoveries about the environment are listed separately at the end, because finding someone else's bug is not the same achievement as not writing one.

Severity is judged by what would have happened if nobody had caught it, not by how embarrassing it was.

## Agent errors

### E1. Extension manifest outside the extension root
**Severity: low.** The MV3 manifest was written into a subdirectory while the module it loaded sat one level above. A browser refuses to load anything above the extension root, so the test bench could never have started.
**Caught by:** the agent, rereading its own layout before publishing.
**Class:** structural knowledge, applied carelessly rather than missing.

### E2. Wire type assumed from a field name
**Severity: high.** `broadcaster_user_id` was sent as a JSON string. The API types it as an integer. Every subscription attempt would have been rejected, which is the first thing a user does after installing the daemon.
**Caught by:** reading the OpenAPI schema while implementing an unrelated feature. Not by a test.
**Why tests missed it:** the test double accepted any JSON body and asserted on the decoded value, which was `"123"` and looked correct. The double was written by the same process that held the wrong belief.
**Fix:** assert the wire type, not the decoded value. `strings.Contains(body, '"broadcaster_user_id":123456')` fails when the value is quoted.

### E3. Payload shape guessed and correct by luck
**Severity: high if wrong, zero as it turned out.** Channel filtering depended on `broadcaster.user_id` existing in every webhook payload. That structure was inferred, never checked. Had it been wrong, the filter would have extracted nothing, matched nothing, and delivered an idle stream with no error anywhere.
**Caught by:** deliberate audit after E2, comparing against the documented payloads.
**Class:** unverified assumption in a load-bearing position. The outcome was luck; the process was the defect.

### E4. Request shape assumed for an endpoint that could not be reached
**Severity: high.** The token fetch sent only `Accept`. The real client sends session cookies plus three headers, one of which is a public client constant. The endpoint is blocked outside a browser and blocked by CORS from a page, so the assumption had never been testable, and the code shipped anyway.
**Caught by:** hooking `fetch` in a live page, then closing the websocket to force a reconnect so the token request would replay under the hook.
**Class:** the agent knew it could not verify and shipped as if it had.

### E5. False positive on a backup risk report
**Severity: medium, and corrosive.** A repository was reported as holding five commits that existed nowhere else. It was actually eight commits *behind* its remote. The heuristic counted the whole history as unpushed whenever a branch had no upstream.
**Caught by:** running the tool against the real machine and checking the alarming result before reporting it as fact.
**Cost if unfixed:** a backup report that cries wolf gets ignored, which removes the value of the true positives sitting next to it.
**Fix:** report `ahead` only when measured against an actual upstream. A branch with a remote but no upstream is labelled untracked, which says nothing either way, because that is the truth.

### E6. `.git` assumed to be a directory
**Severity: medium.** Worktrees and submodules store `.git` as a file. The tool declared them "not a repository", which silently skipped the checkouts most likely to hold forgotten work.
**Caught by:** asking what the tool assumed, then building a real worktree to check.

### E7. Scanner returned success on an unreadable path
**Severity: medium.** A credential scanner intended for a pre-push hook printed "not a git repository" to stderr and exited zero. A typo in the path would have produced a green, meaningless check.
**Caught by:** the agent's own manual probe of an invalid path, not by the test suite it had just written.
**Fix:** distinct exit code for "could not scan", separate from "scanned and clean".

### E8. Pattern matched inside a base64 blob
**Severity: low, high noise.** A token pattern matched a fragment of a Flask session cookie stored in a test fixture, reported as a Discord bot token.
**Caught by:** inspecting the finding instead of reporting it.
**Fix:** anchor patterns at a boundary. The search tool speaks POSIX regex with no lookbehind, so the boundary is enforced in a second pass in the host language.

### E9. Parsed a 15 MB file on a 128 MB production board
**Severity: medium, operational.** To measure a file, the agent loaded and traversed it in place. On a board with 128 MB of RAM already using swap, the process ran for ten minutes without finishing, drove load average from 3 to 6.3, and had to be killed.
**Caught by:** the agent, watching the load it had caused.
**Class:** no model of the cost of its own probe. The measurement should have been streaming from the first attempt.
**What it should have done:** sample. The answer eventually came from counting date occurrences with a streaming filter, in under a second.

### E10. Tested against the wrong service
**Severity: low, near miss.** A smoke test bound to a port already occupied by an unrelated service on the user's machine. The health endpoint answered, the agent briefly read that as its own daemon working.
**Caught by:** the response body not matching the daemon's schema.
**Class:** absence of environment checks before asserting ownership of a resource.

### E11. Killed a process by name
**Severity: low, unquantified.** Cleaning up test processes, the agent killed by image name rather than by the process identifiers it had started. If the user had an unrelated interpreter running, it went down too. This is reported as unquantified because the agent cannot prove it did not.

### E11b. The same kill-by-name error, hours after writing it down
**Severity: medium, self-inflicted on production.** Cleaning up its own leftovers on a board, the agent ran `killall python3`. That stopped two production services: a chat bot and a watcher. One returned by itself under a watchdog; the other had to be restarted through its init script, which then produced a **duplicate** instance, two pollers fighting over the same API token, removed by pid using the service's own pidfile.

**Caught by:** the agent, checking which services survived immediately after. No lasting damage.
**Why it matters more than the first occurrence:** E11 was already written into the agent's persistent rules earlier the same day. The rule existed, was correct, and did not fire, because the action felt like tidying rather than like an intervention. **A rule attached to a category of action does not fire when the action is reclassified as harmless.** The rule was rewritten with the full incident attached rather than restated.
**Cost ratio:** one command of convenience, four commands of repair.

### E12. Repeated path-form errors across shell boundaries
**Severity: low, cumulative.** POSIX paths were handed to Windows binaries and shell variables were eaten crossing three shell layers, costing several wasted round trips.
**Class:** a known environment quirk, documented in the agent's own notes, not applied until it failed.

### E13. A test encoded the old semantics and had to be corrected twice
**Severity: none, listed for honesty.** After changing what "ahead" means, two assertions failed. Both failures were the test being right about the old behaviour. They were corrected, not deleted, and one of them turned into the regression test for E5.

## Environment discoveries

These were found, not caused. They are the reason the session was worth running.

### D1. A monitoring bot reporting zero as a measurement
For ten days, a daily inventory bot fetched nothing, recorded a snapshot of zero items, and sent a report announcing an empty portfolio, marked as successful. The upstream API had started refusing requests. The code logged the failure, returned an empty collection, and let every downstream stage treat emptiness as data.

An abort flag existed for exactly this. It was only ever set inside the pricing loop, which is never entered when the item list is empty. **The safeguard sat downstream of the failure it was meant to catch.**

### D2. A backup verifying clean on two thirds of a machine
Daily, encrypted, pushed, size stable for seventeen days, restore check green. The manifest described the machine as it had been months earlier. Everything added since, including a non-reproducible price history, a live session file, credentials, the DNS configuration and every maintenance script, was absent from every archive.

A backup that fails loudly gets fixed. A backup that succeeds on a stale scope is trusted until the day it is needed.

### D3. A realtime protocol migration nobody announced
A public streaming platform moved off its hosted message bus. The old application key now returns "not in this cluster" on every region. Client code still pointing there fails silently when it has a fallback path, which this one did.

### D4. Credentials committed in a private repository
Two bot tokens in the current checkout, not merely in history. Private, so not a public leak, but a private repository is one setting away from public and history rewriting never un-leaks anything.

### D5. Unbounded growth inside a bounded retention window
A trend file grew nineteen times in seventy days while its retention policy worked correctly. Retention bounded the age of the data, not the width of the universe being sampled. The file now costs more to load than the board can comfortably afford.

## Counting

Fourteen agent errors, one of them a repeat of another written down hours earlier. Four would have shipped broken behaviour to a user (E2, E4, E5, E7). Three were caught by reasoning rather than by tests (E2, E3, E4). One was caught by tests the agent had written (E13, twice). One was operational damage to a live machine (E9).

The ratio worth staring at: **zero of the four shipping-grade defects were caught by the agent's own test suite**, and every one of them lived at a boundary with something the agent could not run.
